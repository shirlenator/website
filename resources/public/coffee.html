    Two weekends ago I went to SC with my mom and picked up some fancy <a
      href="http://www.vervecoffeeroasters.com/collections/coffee/products/karie"
      style="color:black; text-decoration:none">[beans]</a>. My weapon of choice was my new hario v60
    dripper. The coffee came out without aroma, and adjusting the water volume and temperature only affected the
    acidity. I think the only thing I couldn't mask was the
    biting acidity. Like hot stomach acid. 
    <br/>
    <br/>
    The folks down at my favorite coffee shop were serving the Karie by chance.
    According to them, I was under-extracting, and I could try using hotter
    water and pouring more slowly. I gave this a try, and the results were
    astonishing! Tart berries.

    Faith in curiosity, love of this world restored.
